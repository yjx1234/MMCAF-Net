## Proposed method
We propose a new framework called MMCAF-Net. It consists of three main components. The first component is an image encoder that integrates a feature pyramid with E3D-
MSCA module, designed to capture both local and global features of imaging data. This allows for the effective differentiation of challenging cases. The second component employs Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KAN) to encode tabular features. Lastly, the third component utilizes the MSCA module to align and fuse the features from both modalities.

The figure below shows our proposed network.

## Getting started to evaluate
### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data preprocess
Lung-PET-CT-dx dataset can get from this link https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.2020.NNC2-0461
In short, using create_hdf5.py to make an hdf5 file.
